# React

React is a JavaScript library for buliding user interface.

* **Declarative:** React makes it painless to create interactive UIs.Design simple views for each state in your application,and React will effciently update and render just the right components when your data changes.Declarative views make your code more preditable,simpler to understand,and easier to debug.

* **Component-Based:** Bulid encapsulated components that manage their own state,then compose them to make complex UIs.Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates,you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep the state out of the DOM.

* **Learn Once,Write Anywhere:** We don't make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack,so you can develop new features in React without rewriting exiting existing code.React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native.

Learn how to use React in your project.

# **Installation**#

React has been designed for gradual adoption form the start,and **you can user as little or as mush React as you need:**

* User Quick Start to get a taste of React.
* Add React to an Existing Project to use as little or as mush React as you need.
* Create a New React App if you're looking for a powerful JavaScript toolchain.

# Documentation

You can find the React documentation on the wesbsite.

Check out the Getting Started page for quick overview.

The documentation is divided into several sections:

* Quick Start
* Tutorial
* Thinking in React
* Installation
* Describing the UI
* Adding Interactivty
* Managing State
* Advanced Guides 
* API Reference
* Where to Get Support

# Examples

We have several examples on the website.Here is the fitst one to get you started:

```
import{ createRoot } from 'react-dom/client;

fuction HelloMessage({ name }) {
    return <div>Hello {name}</div>;
}

const root = createRoot(document.getElementByIi('container));
root.render(<HelloMessage name="Taylor"/>);
```
This example will render"Hello Taylor"into a container on the page.

You'll notice that we used an HTML-like syntax;we can it JSX.JSX is not required to use React,but it makes code more readable,and writing it feels like writing HTML.
